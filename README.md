### Libs

* [Andt Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/)  - the most downloaded and used UI lib for React, I used it to speed up the implementation process.
* [Style Components](https://styled-components.com/)  - I love css-in-js is like any preprocessor but with steroids, allowing you to do everything you'd normally do with a preprocessor and more.
And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
